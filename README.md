# Chaz Wilder - Final Front-End Capstone

For this project, I opted to use the JSON server as a pseudo-backend. Additionally, I opted to use the material UI kit but an older version.

With that said, you will need to install via: npm install --legacy-peer-deeps.

To run the JSON Server and React server at the same time,you will need to run via npm run dev vs npm start.

Let me know how I did!
